# HyprSupreme-Builder Diagnostic Report

Generated: $(date)
System: CachyOS Linux
Architecture: $(uname -m)
Kernel: $(uname -r)

## 🎉 OVERALL HEALTH STATUS: EXCELLENT ✅

The HyprSupreme-Builder project has been thoroughly diagnosed and is in excellent health. All critical issues have been resolved and the system is fully functional.

## 🔧 Issues Found and Resolved

### 1. ✅ FIXED: Error Handler Variable Conflicts
- **Issue**: Color variables (YELLOW, etc.) were declared as readonly in error handler causing conflicts
- **Resolution**: Removed readonly declarations to prevent conflicts with main scripts
- **Impact**: Install script now works without variable conflicts

### 2. ✅ FIXED: Function Call Order Issues
- **Issue**: `log_message` function called before error modules were loaded
- **Resolution**: Reordered initialization to load modules before calling functions
- **Impact**: Enhanced error system now initializes properly

### 3. ✅ FIXED: Unbound Variable Errors
- **Issue**: Array variables accessed before proper initialization
- **Resolution**: Pre-initialized arrays with default values and added safe array access patterns
- **Impact**: Scripts no longer fail with unbound variable errors

### 4. ✅ FIXED: Here Document Syntax Issues
- **Issue**: Complex variable substitution in here documents causing bad substitution errors
- **Resolution**: Replaced here documents with echo statements for complex variable expansion
- **Impact**: Recovery report generation now works correctly
