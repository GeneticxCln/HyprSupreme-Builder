# üîí Security & Prerequisites Guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notice

**IMPORTANT**: This installation script requires administrative privileges and modifies your system. Please review the following security considerations before proceeding.

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

Our enhanced build script includes several security measures:
